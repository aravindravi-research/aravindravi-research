# Aravind Ravi

Staff Software Engineer and independent researcher working on
**distributed systems, AI control planes, and long-running conversational architectures**.

My research focuses on system-level design for AI agents, including:
- deterministic control planes for conversational systems
- pre-inference intent routing and execution governance
- hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches for safety and predictability
- longitudinal memory and stateful AI architectures

I am the author of *HNIR: A Deterministic Intent Routing Control Plane for Distributed Conversational Systems* (DOI registered).
